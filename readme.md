# ðŸ”— URL Shortener Database

**Hosted by Github Pages**

This is a minimal URL shortener database that can be entirely hosted on GitHub pages. All link issues are kept here.

## Usage

To add a new link:

- Open an issue **with the title being the link you want to shorten** including the `http(s)://` to [/sdb/issues](https://github.com/fluteds/sdb/issues).
  - Note: Closed issues also work with this URL shortener.
- The newly created short url can be accessed via the users default GitHub pages domain or a custom domain (if enabled.)
  - Note: There is no need to put the pound symbol as the URLs look like this: `website.xyz/s/1` instead of this: `website.xyz/s/#1`.

## ShareX Config

This URL shortener can also be used with [ShareX.](https://getsharex.com/)
