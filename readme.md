# ðŸ”— URL Shortener Database

This is a minimal URL shortener database that can be entirely hosted on GitHub pages. All link issues are kept here.

## Usage

Note: Non authenticated submissions are turned off and will not work.

To add a new link:

- Open an issue with the title being the link you want to shorten, including the `http(s)://` to [/sdb/issues](https://github.com/fluteds/sdb/issues).

## Terms

While the repo will currently only work with URLs submitted by myself, the usage terms still apply if you attempt to submit a link.

If you to submit a link you agree to the following:

- Your URL will be publically available and cannot be deleted unless the repo is deleted.
- GitHub has a rate limit of 60 searches without auth which affects how many times you can use the service. Check your rate limit by using CURL. `curl -I https://api.github.com/user`
- Links that go against [GitHub's TOS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines) are not allowed.
